## Core Features:

- Canvas: A blank canvas on which the user may draw.
- Dynamic line weight: Variable line weight depending on drawing speed. Heavier lines with slower drawing speed. 
- Eraser tool: An eraser tool with an adjustable radius. The eraser may cover previous drawing strokes, progressively erasing more of the stroke as the eraser moves across it.
- Export drawing: Option to export the canvas drawing to a standard image format (.jpg or .png).
- AI Stylization Tool: An AI tool that interprets the user's strokes and suggests more polished or stylized versions of the drawing in a corner of the screen for user consideration and adoption. This AI feature serves as a 'style tool'.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft Lavender (#D0B8E6), evokes calmness and creativity.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0), for a clean and distraction-free workspace.
- Accent color: Pale Rose (#E6B8D0), as a contrast to the lavender, to indicate selected controls.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a modern, neutral look, will maintain focus on the visual element.
- Minimalist icons for tool selection. Each icon will subtly reflect its functionality. High contrast for visibility.
- Clean and intuitive layout. All primary function controls arranged to be accessible for pen or touch.
- Subtle animations on UI elements when selected or activated to provide feedback.
